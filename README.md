This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

To collect the data, the moralis API was used.

It uses Prisma to do the data modeling and Nextauth.js for the login, where currently there is the option to log in with an account created on the same page or log in with your Google account.

Deployed in Railway.
